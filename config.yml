# Configuration file for VCS2AWS
# This is what is ensured in AWS
#
# Misc Info:
#  - All instances are tagged as belonging to the class "vcs2vcs"
#  - All volumes are mounted on /dev/xvdf for now, this will cause trouble when
#    multiple volumes are mounted to the same instances, in such a case, specify
#    the mount point via this config and modify the other playbooks accordingly
